eclipse-extended-variables
==========================

Adds an extra variable (resource_locs) to eclipse.
The default list of variables contains variables resource_loc which returns one of the selected file paths. 

Our check in procedure at requires that we run a shell script on all the files that were just checked in.  Before the plug-in this was a complete pain.

I find this plugin useful any time you want to run a script on a bunch of selected files.

Installation
===========================

* Download eclipse-extended-variables.zip 
* unzip into your eclipse directory.
